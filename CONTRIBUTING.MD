The pull request will be reviewed and merged if it is accepted.

For development, I'd recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extensions.

Or if you prefer, you can use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). It has built-in support for ESLint and Prettier.
